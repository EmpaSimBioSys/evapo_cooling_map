# Evaporative cooling potential map

# About
This website () was created to enhance the visualization of the datasets discussed in the paper <b>"Evaporative cooling devices for postharvest storage: where to best use then and how well do they work?"</b>. Please refer to the paper (hyperlink coming soon) for more details.
These maps demonstrate <b>the evaporative cooling potential</b>. This is the temperature depression that can be achieved by cooling the ambient temperature down to dewpoint temperature.</p>
