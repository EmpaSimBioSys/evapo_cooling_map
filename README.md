# Evaporative cooling potential map

# About
This website was created to enhance the visualization of the datasets discussed in the paper <b>"Evaporative cooling devices for postharvest storage: where to best use then and how well do they work?"</b>. Please refer to the paper (hyperlink coming soon) for more details.

These maps demonstrate the evaporative cooling potential. This is the temperature depression that can be achieved by cooling the ambient temperature down to dewpoint temperature.
